# GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). More about GDP and the different approaches in calculating could be found at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. 

By inspecting the Excel file, we looked at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised by country and by GDP components, showcasing the volume in USD from 1970 to 2017.

```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

First we transform the data from a wide format to a long format. Then we tidy the data by expressing all figures in billions, and rename the some indicators into something shorter:

* Exports of goods and services -> Exports
* Imports of goods and services -> Imports
* General government final consumption expenditure -> Government expenditure
* Gross Domestic Product (GDP) -> Gross Domestic Product


```{r reshape_GDP_data}
# check unique values of IndicatorName
unique(UN_GDP_data$IndicatorName)

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  # transform into long format
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to = "year", values_to = "volume") %>% 
  # tidy volumn data into billions
  # shorten indicator name
  mutate(volume_bn = volume / 10^9, IndicatorName = case_when (
    IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household expenditure",
    IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",
    IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports",
    IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government expenditure",
    IndicatorName == "Gross capital formation" ~ "Gross capital formation",
    IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~ "Gross Domestic Product",
    T~"Others")) %>% 
  #keep only the key GDP components
  filter(IndicatorName!="Others")

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Greece")
tidy_GDP_country <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter (Country %in% country_list)

head(tidy_GDP_country)

```

We replicate the chart below:

![](/images/gdp1.png)

```{r}
tidy_GDP_country %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName!="Gross Domestic Product") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(year), y=volume_bn, 
             color = IndicatorName)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_colour_manual("Components of GDP",
                      breaks = c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports"),
                      values = c("orange","brown","green","sky blue","purple")) +
  labs(title = "GDP components over time", 
       x="",
       y="Billion US$", 
       subtitle="In constant 2010 USD")+
  NULL

```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in the dataframe, we would like to calculate it given its components discussed above.

```{r}
GDP_components <- tidy_GDP_country %>% 
  select(-volume) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName,
              values_from = volume_bn)

# modify column names
colnames(GDP_components) <- gsub(" ","_", colnames(GDP_components) )

# calculate GDP
GDP_components <- GDP_components %>% 
  mutate(GDP = Household_expenditure + 
           Government_expenditure + 
           Gross_capital_formation +
           Exports - Imports)

GDP_diff <- GDP_components %>% 
  mutate(difference = (GDP-Gross_Domestic_Product)/Gross_Domestic_Product)

GDP_diff %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=difference))+
  geom_histogram(bins=30) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(difference)))+
  labs(title="Histogram of differences of GDP given and calculated by hand")+
  NULL

# mean(GDP_diff$difference) = 0.6%

```

- We can see the histogram of difference in the graph above. The mean difference is 0.6%

```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
GDP_components %>% 
  mutate(Household_expenditure = Household_expenditure/GDP,
         Government_expenditure  =  Government_expenditure/GDP,
         Gross_capital_formation = Gross_capital_formation/GDP,
         Net_Exports = (Exports - Imports)/GDP) %>% 
  select(c("CountryID","Country","year",
           "Household_expenditure","Government_expenditure","Gross_capital_formation","Net_Exports")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(4:7,
               names_to = "IndicatorName",
               values_to = "percentage") %>% 
  mutate(IndicatorName = gsub("_"," ",IndicatorName)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(year),y=percentage, 
             color = IndicatorName)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  theme_bw() +
  scale_colour_manual("Components of GDP",
                      breaks = c("Gross capital formation", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Net Exports"),
                      values = c("orange","green","sky blue","purple")) +
  labs(title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars",
       x = "",
       y = "proportion",
       caption = "Source: United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads")+
  NULL
```

From the graphs above, we observe that:

- For the three countries analyzed, household expenditure makes up the most of Gross Domestic Product. The household expenditures of US and Greece are increasing while that of India is decreasing. The actual amount of household expenditures surges while the proportion is actually quite stable.

- Net exports makes up the least and are even negative for the most years of all the three countries.

- There could be negative correlation between Gross capital formation and Net exports.
