An individual project exploring the difference in IMDB rating for movies directed by Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, using hypothesis testing by three different approaches

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

We would like to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. First, we tried to replicate the ![graph](/images/directors.png) showing the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap.


To replicate the graph, we first filtered out the movies of these two directors, then group by the director and summarise the mean, std, no. of movies, to calculate the standard error, t_critical and margin of error, to get the confidence interval of the mean ratings of the movies of the two directors.

Then we plotted the data and added error bars to the mean ratings, and indicate the overlap of confidence intervals.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
movies <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'movies.csv'))
# modify the dataset for plot
movies_comp <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) %>%
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
            std_rating = sd(rating),
            count=n(),
            se_rating = std_rating / sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rating,
            rating_low = mean_rating - margin_of_error,
            rating_high = mean_rating + margin_of_error) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_rating))

# plot the data, add error bars and label the datapoint
movies_comp %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=mean_rating,y=fct_relevel(director, levels=c("Tim Burton","Steven Spielberg"))))+
  
  geom_point(size = 5, mapping = aes(color = director))+
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = rating_low, xmax = rating_high, color = director), width = 0.1,size = 1.5)+
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(x=mean_rating, label = round(mean_rating, 2)), size=4, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(x=rating_low, label = round(rating_low, 2)),size = 3, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(x=rating_high, label = round(rating_high, 2)),size = 3, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +

# plot the grey rectangle to show the overlap of confidence intervals
  geom_rect(xmin = 7.27,xmax = 7.33, ymin=0, ymax=Inf, alpha=0.4)+
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence interval overlap",
       x = "Mean IMDB Rating",
       y = "") +
  NULL

```

In addition, we ran a hypothesis test using both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where we assume zero difference between the two.

First of all, the Null hypothesis and the alternaltive hypothesis are:

- H0: Spielburg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings for the movies they direct
- H1: Spielburg has a different mean IMDB ratings from Burton

```{r}
# movies_comp

# calculate p_value by hand
t_stat =  (7.57-6.93)/sqrt(0.695*0.695/23 + 0.749*0.749/16)
# p_value = 2*0.0035
p_value = 2*(1-pt(2.7,37))
paste("t_stat:",t_stat)
paste("p_value:",p_value)

```

As we can see from the calculation above, the t_stat by hand:t_stat = 2.7, p_value = 0.01, indicating that H0 should be rejected.

Next we use the `t.test` command:

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

movies_hypo <- movies %>%
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) 

t.test(rating ~ director, data = movies_hypo)

```

- From the `t.test`, we get the t statistics at 2.7 and the p-value at 0.01, which deliver the same message that H0 should be rejected. 

Finally, we run the simulation from a null distribution where we hypothesize that the meaning ratings for Speilburg and Burton are the same.

```{r}

diff <- movies_hypo %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

set.seed(1234)
null_dist_movies <- movies_hypo %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

null_dist_movies %>% 
  visualise()+
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = diff, direction = "two-sided")

p_value <- null_dist_movies %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = diff, direction="both")

p_value

```

- The exercise gives a p value of 0.008. 

- Three methods deliver the same message that H0 should be rejected. We are 95% confident that Spielburg's movies are rated higher on IMDB than Burton's movies.
