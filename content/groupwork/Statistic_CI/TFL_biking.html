<p>We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.</p>

<p>In May and June of 2020 there is a huge decline in bike rentals due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>We will know reproduce the following graph. The graph looks at the monthly change in TfL from the monthly averages calculated in 2016-2019. The blue line is the mean bike rentals of the months over 2016-2019. The red shaded region shows the months where the monthly rentals fell below the average and the green shows the months where it was above the average.</p>

<p>Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?</p>
<p>In our graphs we calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation <code>excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals</code>. The bike rentals seem to be normally distributed and the mean is a good representation of the population mean. The graphs are identical when the mean is used and since we are trying to replicate the graphs we have used the mean.</p>
