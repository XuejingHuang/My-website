A group project on visualising the approval margin for Biden and its evolution over time.

# Biden's Approval Margins

We will now start our analysis of Biden's approval ratings. Fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings) 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.

approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate),
         startdate = mdy(startdate),
         enddate = mdy(enddate), 
         createddate = mdy(createddate))

```

## Creating a Plot

Now we will calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since Biden got into office. We will plot Biden's net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. For the date, we will use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

``` {r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

# Calculating net approval rates per poll and grouping by week 
approval_polls <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(net_approval_rate = approve - disapprove) %>%
  mutate(enddate_week = isoweek(enddate)) %>%
  group_by(enddate_week) %>%
  summarise(avg_rate = mean(net_approval_rate, na.rm=TRUE),  # Calculating Confidence Interval
            sd_rate = sd(net_approval_rate, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            #get T-critical value with (n-l) degrees of freedom
            se_rate = sd_rate/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rate,
            rate_low = avg_rate - margin_of_error,
            rate_high = avg_rate + margin_of_error) 

# Plotting Data Set 
plot <- approval_polls %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=enddate_week, y=avg_rate)) +
  geom_point(color="orange", size=2)+
  geom_line(color="orange", size=1.0)+
  geom_smooth(color="blue", se=F) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=rate_low, ymax=rate_high, color="light grey", alpha=0.01), fill="grey70")  +
    #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs (title = "Net Biden Approval/Dissaproval Weekly", subtitle="Weekly Average of All Polls",
    y = "Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)", x= "Week of the Year") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color="orange", size=2) +
    NULL

## Comparing Confidence Intervals

In the bottom graph, the confidence intervals for week 3 and week 25 are very different. This could be due to a difference in sample size, or variation in responses. We believe it is more likely that the difference is due to week 3 having a much smaller sample size. 

In the top graph we compared week 4 and week 25. There is not much of a difference in confidence intervals, suggesting the sample size is probably similar for both week 4 and week 25.
