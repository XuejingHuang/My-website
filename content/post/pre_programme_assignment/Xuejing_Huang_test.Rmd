# My short biography
I am Xuejing Huang, 22 years old, graduated from Fudan Univ. with a BSc degree in Physics.  
In my spare time, I enjoy doing:  

- playing with my cat _Snowball_
- watching classic movies
- cooking
- boxing


Snowball is a [ragdoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll). She is now one and half years old and she has a pair of beautiful blue eyes!
